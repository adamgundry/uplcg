# Untitled PL Card Game

## Adding cards

You can edit the cards in [cards.yaml](cards.yaml).

## Event Info

Untitled PL Card Game is a game heavily inspired by [Cards Against Humanity],
[Cards Against Cryptography], and [Apples to Apples].

We've created custom cards that relate to ICFP2020 and free of the racism,
sexism and homophobia appearing in the original version.

Another change we've made to the game is that there is a democratic voting round
at the end of each play phase, rather than the starting player picking the
winner.

The game can be fully played in the browser, but we'll have a video call along
the side to make it more social.
